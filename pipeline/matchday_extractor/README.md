## Data Processing Pipeline

This repository contains modules for processing and normalizing football match data in JSON format.  
**Note:**  
The process of acquiring or scraping raw data is **not** included. This pipeline assumes that the necessary raw JSON files are already present and available locally.

All data processing and normalization steps comply with best practices for data handling, ensuring a clear separation between data acquisition and data analysis.
